# Password Strength Checker

This is a Python-based Password Strength Checker with a dynamic and engaging user interface. It provides real-time feedback on the security of passwords, helping users understand the strength of their passwords and how they can improve them.

## Features

- **Real-Time Feedback:** As you type your password, the UI updates instantly to reflect the password strength.
- **Strength Meter:** A visual indicator that shows the strength of your password, color-coded for easy understanding.
- **Common Patterns Detection:** Identifies and flags passwords that follow common patterns, making them more vulnerable to attacks.
- **Estimated Time to Crack:** Calculates how long it would take to brute-force the password based on a 1 million attempts per second estimate.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Password-Strength-Checker.git

This program requires a list of common passwords to function effectively. You can use a pre-existing common_passwords.txt file or create your own.

Option 1: Download a Common Passwords File
Download a commonly used password list, such as rockyou.txt or another list of common passwords.
Rename the file to common_passwords.txt.
Place the common_passwords.txt file in the same directory as the password_strength_checker.py script.
Option 2: Create Your Own Passwords File
Create a text file named common_passwords.txt.
Populate it with a list of common passwords, with each password on a new line.
Place this file in the same directory as the password_strength_checker.py script.
